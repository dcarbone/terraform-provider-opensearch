## Schema

### Optional

- `addresses` (List of String) List of addresses to connect to
- `ca_cert` (String, Sensitive) PEM Encoded certificate authorities
- `client_debug_logger` (Object) OpenSearch client debug logging configuration.  This writes debug-level logging directly to stdout.  Do not enable outside of a local development environment. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--client_debug_logger))
- `compress_request_body` (Boolean) Enable request body compression
- `disable_retry` (Boolean) Disable all request retries
- `enable_on_request_check` (Boolean) By default, the opensearch-go client executes a "compatibility check" on every single request made.  This has been disabled by default in this provider.  If you wish to re-enable this, for whatever reason, set this to true.
- `enable_retry_on_timeout` (Boolean) Enables request retry on timeout
- `insecure_skip_tls_verify` (Boolean) Disable TLS verification
- `max_retries` (Number) Maximum number of times a given request can be retried
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for HTTP basic authentication
- `request_trace_logger` (Object) OpenSearch client request tracing logger configuration.  This writes TRACE level Terraform logs of every HTTP action by the opensearch-go client.  Can produce very chatty logs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--request_trace_logger))
- `retry_on_status` (List of Number) List of status codes for retry
- `skip_init_product_check` (Boolean) Skip product check API call on configure
